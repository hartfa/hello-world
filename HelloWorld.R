print("Hello World")

# great job!

# let's keep it going :)

# lesson 1: variable assignment

# here is a refresher on how to assign a value to a variable:
# variable <- some value
# in this example, I am assigning the string "Grace" to the variable `name`
# a string is a datatype which is represented by text in quotation marks (either single or double quotes)

name <- "Grace"

# now, the string "Grace" is stored in the variable `name` and we can access that variable elsewhere in our script

# lesson 2: using built-in functions with variables

# a function is a piece of reusable code which we can call with its given name and a pair of parentheses
# the things we put inside of the parenthesis are called arguments

# in your "Hello World" script, you've already passed the string "Hello World" into the print() function as print("Hello World")

# we can also pass variables as arguments to the print() function

# exercise 1: insated if printing "Hello World", use print() to pring the variable `name`

print(name)
